Vibras Live is a platform for discovering and promoting social dance events in Singapore, especially in the Latin dance scene including salsa, bachata, kizomba, and more.

The site provides an up-to-date listing of socials happening today, tomorrow, and the day after—along with event posters, DJs, venues, and other useful details to help dancers get a feel for the vibe of each social. It’s designed to be simple, mobile-friendly, and focused on what dancers actually care about.

In addition to the web platform, Vibras Live includes:
- 📱 A mobile app for organizers to list and promote their events
- 🤖 A Telegram bot for real-time event updates and conversational queries like "What socials are happening tonight?"

Whether you're a dancer looking for your next social or an organizer wanting to promote your event more effectively, Vibras Live is built for you.
